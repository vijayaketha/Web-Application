      <h2> Vintage clothing</h2>
      <p> Vintage clothing is clothing that originates from a previous era. The term vintage clothing can also be applied in reference to second-hand retail outlets, e.g. in "vintage clothing store". 
        While the concept originated during World War I as a response to textile shortages,[1] vintage dressing encompasses choosing accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an 
        ensemble of various styles and periods. Vintage clothes typically sell at low prices for high-end name brands.</p>
